# SLR-Automation-with-GPT-4

## Introduction
This project builds upon the previous work in [AI Paper Retrieval and Upload Script](https://github.com/HosungYou/AI-Paper-Retrieval-and-Upload-Script), providing a sequential workflow for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLR). The initial project focuses on retrieving academic papers from the CORE repository and uploading them to Google Drive, while this repository automates the subsequent evaluation of these papers using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

The script connects directly to a specified Google Drive folder containing PDF papers retrieved from the previous project, extracts text from each PDF, evaluates it based on SLR inclusion criteria, and records the results in a Google Sheet. The goal is to assist researchers in automating the screening and quality assessment process for SLRs in social sciences, focusing on detailed evaluation criteria while leveraging the strengths of AI-based assessments.

Users can follow the steps provided in the linked repository to collect the academic papers and then use this repository to perform automated quality assessments, making the entire SLR process more efficient and streamlined.

## Features
- **Direct PDF Processing from Google Drive**: Processes PDFs directly from a specified Google Drive folder without needing to download them locally.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDFs, focusing on the first few pages to stay within GPT-4's context window.
- **Automated Quality Assessment (QA)**: Uses GPT-4 to assess each paper based on SLR inclusion criteria:
  - Relevance to the research focus
  - Clarity of proposed framework or methodology
  - Contribution to the field
  - Discussion of limitations
  - Methodology description quality
- **Detailed Justification**: Provides justifications for each evaluation, making the quality assessment transparent and reproducible.
- **Results Recording**: Writes the evaluation results, justifications, and a final QA score to a specified Google Sheet for easy review and reference.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Google Cloud Service Account**:
  - A service account JSON key file (`service_account.json`)
  - Access to Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs
- **OpenAI API Key**: Access to the GPT-4 model via OpenAI API
- **Required Python Libraries**:
  - `openai`
  - `requests`
  - `google-auth`
  - `google-api-python-client`
  - `PyPDF2`
  - `tqdm`
- **Google Drive Folder**: A folder in Google Drive containing PDF files to be evaluated

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HosungYou/SLR-Automation-with-GPT-4.git
   cd SLR-Automation-with-GPT4
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Place Credentials in Project Directory**:
   - Copy the `service_account.json` file to the project directory.
   - Ensure that this file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

## Configuration
1. **Configure the Script Parameters**:
   - Open `script.py` in a text editor.
   - Modify the following variables in the Configuration Section:
     ```python
     SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
     SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'service_account.json'  # Path to your Google Cloud service account credentials
     SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID'  # Google Sheet ID where results will be saved
     OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'  # OpenAI API key for GPT-4
     GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID'  # Google Drive folder ID containing the papers
     ```
   - Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Use environment variables to store sensitive data like API keys. Example:
     ```python
     import os
     OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
     ```
   - Set the environment variable before running the script:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
     ```

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python script.py
```
### Workflow:
1. **Authentication**: Authenticates with Google Drive and Google Sheets using service account credentials.
2. **Process PDFs**: Reads and processes each PDF, extracts text, and evaluates it using GPT-4.
3. **Record Results**: Writes evaluation results, justifications, and a final QA score to the specified Google Sheet.

## Google Sheet Structure
To accommodate maximum information, the Google Sheet used for storing SLR assessments will include the following columns:
1. **Article Title**: The name of the paper being evaluated.
2. **Related to Context?**: (Yes/No/Partially) - Is the paper related to the defined social science context?
   - **Justification**: Specific excerpt from the paper justifying the assessment.
3. **Proposed Framework/Methodology?**: (Yes/No/Partially) - Does the paper propose a framework or methodology?
   - **Justification**: Text reference supporting the evaluation.
4. **Contribution to Field?**: (Yes/No/Partially) - Does the paper clearly explain its contribution?
   - **Justification**: Supporting excerpt from the paper.
5. **Discussion of Limitations?**: (Yes/No/Partially) - Does the paper discuss its limitations and the reliability of its results?
   - **Justification**: Justifying text excerpt.
6. **Methodology Detail?**: (Yes/No/Partially) - Is the methodology explained in sufficient detail?
   - **Justification**: Excerpt from the paper.
7. **Total QA Score**: (0 to 5, calculated) - Calculated based on "Yes" (1.0), "Partially" (0.5), "No" (0.0).

## Scoring Logic
The total QA score is calculated based on the following criteria:
- **"Yes"**: 1.0 point
- **"Partially"**: 0.5 points
- **"No"**: 0.0 points

The script adds up the scores for all criteria to compute the final QA score for each paper, with a maximum possible score of 5. This score is written to the Google Sheet to give an overall quality assessment of the paper.

## Code Overview
- **`authenticate_google_services()`**: Authenticates with Google APIs using service account credentials.
- **`process_pdfs_from_drive(drive_service, sheets_service, folder_id)`**: Connects to Google Drive, iterates over PDF files, and evaluates them using GPT-4.
- **`extract_text_from_pdf(file_stream, max_pages=5)`**: Extracts text from a PDF file, limiting extraction to the first `max_pages` pages.
- **`evaluate_pdf_with_gpt(text)`**: Uses GPT-4 to evaluate the extracted text based on SLR criteria and provides justifications.
- **`calculate_total_score(evaluation_data)`**: Calculates the total QA score based on individual criterion scores.
- **`write_data_to_google_sheets(sheets_service, sheet_id, data)`**: Writes evaluation data, including justifications and the total QA score, to a specified Google Sheet.
- **`main()`**: Orchestrates the entire workflow.

## Limitations
- **Context Length**: GPT-4 has a maximum context length. The script limits text extraction to accommodate this.
- **OpenAI API Usage**: Processing large numbers of papers may incur significant API usage and costs. Monitor your usage in the OpenAI dashboard.
- **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of OpenAI's rate limits and consider adding delays if necessary.
- **Accuracy of GPT-4 Evaluations**: GPT-4's assessments may not always align perfectly with human judgments. Use evaluations as guidance rather than definitive conclusions.
